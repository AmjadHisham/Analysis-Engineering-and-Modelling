# Analysis-Engineering-and-Modelling
A Repo of various End-to-End analysis in statistical approach, exploratory data analysis (EDA) , feature engineering and modelling. 
Along with just Analysis of various data, visualization of data.

I will keep updating this repo once i add explanations to other notebooks and for reference in the future, also as i work on new datasets.

# Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- IPython
- Jupyter notebook
- Usual Data Science Packages as they appear in the code.

Use `pip` to install the packages or get the `wheel` format of the packages from python package repository here[->](https://pypi.org/) or to make life easier go with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
as there might be some version clash between different libraries.

Also, take note what architecture (32bit or 64bit) python is and install lib's accordingly :) Especially `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-gpu` which needs to be 64bit.

## Disclaimer
I use pycharm with dark theme and layout so some of my visualization setting might not be pleasing in some jupyter notebooks so please change them to your liking.

## Usage
Free to use the notebooks, ideas and code as you see fit for your own work.
